This repository includes the corpus of Greek, Middle Persian, and Parthian versions of the inscription aligned at both sentence and word levels, and a dataset of the named entities. 
The corpus follows the line numbering of Huyse. The Greek text is taken from the digital epigraphy collection of the Packard Humanities Institute, which uses the edition of Canali De Rossi. The Parthian and middle Persian versions are based on Huyse's edition. The Parthian verion is taken from Jake Nabel's digital resource at http://parthiansources.com,and the middle Persian was added by me.
The alignments were produced using Ugarit alignment tool. All alignments are available openly online on Ugarit here: https://ugarit.ialigner.com/userProfile.php?userid=40&tgid=21881
The extracted alignment pairs are made available both as one file (xslx, csv and tsv) and also as seperate files (csv and xlsx) in zip, where name of each file is the line number.
The named entity datasets includes nearly 400 named entities were extracted and classified manually as persons (PER), locations (LOC), or location derivatives (LOCderiv).The dataset includes the named entities across all three versions (if available) and the line number in which they appear. A few also include a reference to Wikidata.
